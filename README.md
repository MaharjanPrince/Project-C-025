# Input function
This is a input function that takes input from the user in the form of string and store it in a 2D matrix of characters of any order as per the user desire.  
If the data is stored as integer(%d) while taking input from the user a very loop has to be executed i.e. for i and j. If a maze of higher order has to be solved like of order 1000x1000 user has to input all the 1000000 digits individually which is not practical. In input, starting is 'S' and ending is 'E' are taken which is a character.
